# Security Policy

The security of this project is taken seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose any findings and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided only for the latest released version of this
library on PyPI. Users are strongly encouraged to keep their installations up
to date.

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting:

[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/frenck/probatio/security/advisories/new)

If for any reason you are unable to use GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting, you may also reach out to the maintainer by email at
[opensource@frenck.dev](mailto:opensource@frenck.dev).

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept.
- Affected version(s) of the library.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** you will receive an acknowledgement of your report
  within **48 hours**.
- **Initial assessment:** a triage and initial severity assessment will be
  shared within **7 days** of the acknowledgement.
- **Fix and disclosure:** valid reports are targeted for resolution and
  coordinated public disclosure within **90 days** of the initial report,
  depending on complexity and impact.

You will be kept informed throughout the process and credited in the release
notes for the fix, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities in this project:

- Vulnerabilities in upstream or transitive dependencies. These are handled
  continuously by [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and
  addressed through regular dependency updates.
- Issues only reproducible on Python versions older than those listed as
  supported in `pyproject.toml`.
- Resource exhaustion (such as deep recursion or large inputs) caused by
  validating untrusted data without your own limits in place. This library
  validates the data you hand it; bounding the size and shape of that data is
  the responsibility of the calling application.

## Scope

This security policy covers the `probatio` Python package published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/probatio/) and its source code in this
repository.
